**Construction Patterns**  
This series of exercises focuses on the implementation of advanced software design patterns for building flexible and modular systems.

Builder Pattern  
The first level focuses on the Builder pattern. A pizza order management system is developed, where this pattern allows for the creation of complex Pizza objects with different combinations of size, dough, and toppings in a clear and controlled manner. The construction process is decoupled from the final representation, making it easy to create pizzas with various configurations without overloading the constructors.

Observer Pattern  
The second level delves into the Observer pattern. A stock agency notification system is created, where a StockBroker (the observable object) automatically notifies multiple StockAgencies (the observers) when there is a change in the market. This pattern establishes a one-to-many relationship, ensuring that changes in the observable object are efficiently communicated to all its dependents.

Callback Pattern  
The final level explores the Callback pattern, simulating a payment gateway. A shoe store uses this gateway to process payments without needing to know the details of the specific method (credit card, PayPal, etc.). The pattern is implemented so that the gateway invokes the encapsulated payment method and returns control to the original class once the transaction is complete, allowing for a flexible and extensible design for future payment methods.
